# Infertility-prediction-using-Machine-Learning

PROJECT TITLE:-
PREDICTING FERTILITY BASED ON LIFESTYLE & MEDICAL FACTORS USING MACHINE LEARNING

DOMAIN: - 	
HEALTHCARE DATA

PROBLEM STATEMENT:-
Infertility is a growing health concern among the women globally, it’s often influenced by lifestyle, hormonal imbalance, and underlying medical conditions like PCOS.
Early detection and intervention can improve treatment outcomes.
This project aims to build a predictive model to identify the likelihood of infertility-related risks using patient lifestyle and clinical features.
In this project, we approach infertility prediction through the classification of PCOS presence, which is a major clinical indicator of infertility risk. Using patient health and lifestyle data, we train machine learning classifiers to identify patterns associated with infertility-prone individual

OBJECTIVE: -
To analyze and predictive infertility risk using supervised machine learning algorithms based on patient demography lifestyle, and clinical data.
This model will support early detection of PCOS and other infertility markers through the data-driven insights.

OUTCOME: -
	A trained and evaluated Machine Learning model that predicts infertility risk.
	Insightful visualizations highlight key contributing factors.
	A ready-to-use pipeline for data cleaning, preprocessing and modeling.
	Potential for integration into digital health tools for early screening.

BRAINSTORM:-
	PCOS dataset is chosen from Kaggle.
	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the clinical dataset.
	Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
	Encode categorical features and scale numerical data.
	Apply classification algorithms like Logistic regression, Random Forest or XGBoost
	Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall and f-1 score.
	Interpret results and visualize influential predictors.


DESCRIPTION:-
This dataset consists of medical records and lifestyle features of women, including hormone levels, BMI, Cycle regularity, No.of abortions, and insulin resistance markers. Infertility prediction and PCOS diagnosis were the initial uses of the data.With more than 500 entries, it has both classified an numerical elements.


TARGET:-
PCOS(Y/N)- Indicates the presence of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a common cause for infertility.

About this data:-

	This dataset contains all physical and clinical parameters to determine PCOS and infertility related issues. There are a total of 44 parameters.
	This data is collected from 10 different hospitals across Kerala, India.
	The unit used is feet to cm
	Blood pressure entered as systolic and diastolic separately
	RBS means Random glucose test
	Beta-HCG cases are mentioned as Case I and II
	Blood Group indications: A+ = 11, A- = 12, B+ = 13, B- = 14, O+ =15, O- = 16, AB+ =17, AB- = 18
